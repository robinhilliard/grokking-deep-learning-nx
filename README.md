# grokking-deep-learning-nx

Examples from *Grokking Deep Learning* ported to 
Elixir Nx. Skips notebooks and stuff that doesn't 
exercise Nx tensor capabilities.

I am new to Nx so there are probably better ways
to do most of this, happy to accept PRs. Keep in mind that
the aim is for the ported versions to more or less correspond
to the NumPy examples. If this makes things a bit contrived then
that's ok, I'll try to address in the comments.
